## What We Do

At Froogle AI, we are committed to transforming the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of deep learning processes. Our focus is on developing advanced solutions that optimize GPU utilization during both the training and inference stages of model development. Here’s how we make a difference:

- **Reducing GPU Costs**: By enhancing the processing speed and efficiency of GPUs, we dramatically decrease the expenses associated with running complex AI models.
- **Increasing Speed**: Our proprietary technologies accelerate the training and inference phases, enabling faster model iterations and quicker deployment.
- **Data-Efficient ML**: We leverage cutting-edge research in data-efficient machine learning to ensure that our models perform optimally with less data, reducing the resource footprint and improving outcomes.

Our solutions are designed for scalability and impact, helping organizations of all sizes implement more efficient AI without compromising on performance.

| Veljko Kovac has several years of AI modeling experience. Published at top tier conferences. He holds an MSc in AI from the University of Amsterdam and received an award of ELLIS Honours supervised by Petar Velickovic who is a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind and Prof. Pietro Liò who is a professor at the University of Cambridge. His AI models in Hong Kong Hospital Authority have been deployed in all public hospitals in Hong Kong, successfully assisting the doctors in their every day routine. | Charlie Dickens was previously a research scientist at Yahoo working on the DataSketches team. His research interests are in randomized algorithms for large-scale data analysis and machine learning, as well as fundamental matrix computations. Between 2016-2021, he was a PhD student at the University of Warwick’s Department of Computer Science, supervised by Graham Cormode. His PhD won the Faculty of Science, Engineering and Medicine Thesis Prize in Computer Science. |
